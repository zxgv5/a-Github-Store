## 🚀 Features

</div>

- **Smart discovery**
    - Home sections for "Trending", "Hot Release", and "Most Popular" projects with time‑based filters.
    - Curated discovery layer through the GitHub Store backend, with the live GitHub passthrough as a backup so freshness is honest.
    - Only repos with valid installable assets are shown.
    - Platform‑aware topic scoring so Android/desktop users see relevant apps first.
    - Search with filters for platform, programming language, and sort order.
    - Search history — recent queries are saved locally and shown as suggestions.
    - Clipboard link detection — automatically detects GitHub URLs from your clipboard and offers quick navigation.
    - Hide seen repos — optionally filter out repositories you've already viewed from discovery feeds.

- **Release browser & installs**
    - Release picker to browse and install from any release, not just the latest.
    - Fetches all releases for each repository.
    - Single "Install latest" action, plus an expandable list of all available releases and their installers.
    - Manual install option with automatic compatibility checks.
    - **APK Inspect** (Android) — peek inside any release before installing. Surfaces app label, signing fingerprint, version codes, min/target SDK, components, file metadata, and grouped permissions colour‑coded by protection level.

- **Download mirror system**
    - Multi‑source race against the direct GitHub CDN, helpful on networks where `github.com` is throttled.
    - End‑to‑end SHA‑256 verification against GitHub's published asset digests.
    - Curated community mirror list, updateable from the backend without an app release.
    - Custom mirror URL for self‑hosted `gh-proxy`‑style instances.
    - Auto‑suggest sheet after sustained slow downloads — opt in with one tap, dismissable, never nags.

- **Rich details screen**
    - App name, version and share action.
    - Stars, forks, open issues.
    - Rendered README content ("About this app") with optional translation to the user's chosen language.
    - Release notes with Markdown formatting for any selected release.
    - List of installers with platform labels and file sizes.
    - Pre‑release channel chip — toggle "Include betas" / "Stable only" per app, with a "switch to stable" rollback when a clean stable exists.
    - "Merged what's changed since v1.0" — concatenated release notes for every version skipped between updates.
    - Deep linking support — open repository details via `githubstore://`, `github.com`, or `github-store.org` URLs.
    - Developer profile screen to explore a developer's repositories and activity.

- **App management**
    - Open, uninstall, and downgrade installed apps directly from GitHub Store.
    - **Library Imports** (Android) — recognises GitHub‑sourced apps already on the device (Obtainium, sideload, F‑Droid). Three match strategies (manifest hint, signing fingerprint, backend lookup); high‑confidence matches link silently, the rest land in a one‑tap review wizard. Run on demand from Apps overflow → Scan for GitHub apps.
    - **Link apps** — connect any app already installed on your device to its GitHub repository so GitHub Store can track updates for it. A guided flow lets you pick the app, enter the repo URL, and select the matching release asset.
    - **Sectioned Apps screen** — updates, pending installs, and installed apps grouped so you see what needs attention first.
    - Android: APK architecture matching (armv7/armv8), package monitoring, and update tracking.
    - Android: Shizuku and Sui silent installation — install and update apps without prompts (requires [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/) or Sui running with ADB or root).
    - Android: Background update checking — configurable periodic checks (3h / 6h / 12h / 24h) with notifications when updates are found.
    - Android: Auto‑update — silently installs available updates via Shizuku/Sui when enabled.
    - Desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux): downloads installers to the user's Downloads folder and opens them with the default handler.

- **Collections**
    - **Starred** — browse your GitHub starred repositories from within the app.
    - **Favourites** — save repositories locally for quick access, no GitHub login required.
    - **Recently viewed** — automatically tracks repositories you've opened for easy return.

- **Cross‑version communication**
    - **What's new sheet** — one‑shot release highlights on first launch after each update, plus a permanent history under Profile → What's new.
    - **Announcements feed** — privacy notices, surveys, security advisories, and news in Profile. Anonymous backend feed; dismissal and read state stay on the device.

- **Authentication**
    - GitHub OAuth via the device flow, routed through the backend by default so sign‑in keeps working on networks that throttle `github.com`. Falls back to direct GitHub on infrastructure errors.
    - **Personal Access Token sign‑in** for users whose network blocks the OAuth browser flow entirely. Validates locally, full feature parity with the OAuth path.

- **Tweaks**
    - Dedicated settings screen accessible from the bottom navigation bar.
    - **Appearance** — theme color picker (Dynamic, Ocean, Purple, Forest, Slate, Amber), light/dark/system mode, AMOLED black theme, system font toggle, liquid glass UI effect, scrollbar toggle (desktop).
    - **Network** — proxy configuration with HTTP/SOCKS support and optional authentication; download‑mirror picker with latency test.
    - **Installation** (Android) — choose between default installer and Shizuku/Sui silent install, with real‑time installer status indicator.
    - **Updates** (Android) — update check interval, pre‑release inclusion, auto‑update toggle.
    - **Storage** — view and clear downloaded package cache.
    - **Send feedback** — bug reports, feature ideas, and change requests sent as email or a pre‑filled GitHub issue. Diagnostics card shows exactly what's being sent before you send it.

- **Localization**
    - Available in 13 languages: English, Arabic, Bengali, Chinese (Simplified), Spanish, French, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Russian, and Turkish.

- **Network & performance**
    - Dynamic proxy support (HTTP, SOCKS, System) for configurable network routing.
    - Enhanced caching system for faster loading and reduced API usage.
    - Anonymous backend at `api.github-store.org` for auth proxy, curated discovery, and the announcements feed. Open source under Apache 2.0 — self‑hostable.

  ## FAQ
  
</div>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔍 How does my app appear in GitHub Store?</strong></summary>

<br/>

GitHub Store does not use any private indexing or manual curation rules.
Your project can appear automatically if it follows these conditions:

1. **Public repository on GitHub**
    - Visibility must be `public`.

2. **Installable assets in the latest release**
    - The latest release must contain at least one asset file with a supported extension:
        - Android: `.apk`
        - Windows: `.exe`, `.msi`
        - macOS: `.dmg`, `.pkg`
        - Linux: `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage`, `.pkg.tar.zst`
    - GitHub Store ignores GitHub's auto‑generated source artifacts (`Source code (zip)` /
      `Source code (tar.gz)`).

3. **Discoverable by search / topics**
    - Repositories are fetched via the public GitHub Search API.
    - Topic, language, and description help the ranking:
        - Android apps: topics like `android`, `mobile`, `apk`.
        - Desktop apps: topics like `desktop`, `windows`, `linux`, `macos`, `compose-desktop`,
          `electron`.
    - Having at least a few stars makes it more likely to appear under Trending/Hot Release/Most Popular sections.

If your repo meets these conditions, GitHub Store can find it through search and show it
automatically—no manual submission required.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>✅ Pros / Why use GitHub Store?</strong></summary>

<br/>

- **No more hunting through GitHub releases**
  See only repos that actually ship binaries for your platform.

- **Knows what you installed**
  Tracks apps installed via GitHub Store (Android) and highlights when new releases are available, so you can update them without hunting through GitHub again.

- **Always up to date**
  Installs default to the latest published release, with the option to browse and install from
  any previous release via the release picker. Background update checks notify you when new versions drop.

- **Hands‑free updates (Android)**
  Enable Shizuku or Sui silent install + auto‑update and never touch an install prompt again.

- **Your library, your way**
  Star, favourite, and track recently viewed repos — all synced locally with no account required for favourites and history.

- **Fully customizable**
  Theme colors, AMOLED mode, fonts, liquid glass effects, proxy settings, and more — all in one Tweaks screen.

- **Open source & extensible**
  Written in KMP with a clear separation between networking, domain logic, and UI—easy to fork,
  extend, or adapt.

## 🔑 GitHub OAuth Configuration

</div>

**TL;DR**
1. Create a GitHub OAuth App
2. Copy **Client ID**
3. Put it in `local.properties`

<details>
<summary><strong>Show full setup guide</strong></summary>

<br/>

### 1 - Create a GitHub OAuth App

Go to:
**GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → OAuth Apps → New OAuth App**

| Field                          | Value                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Application name**           | Anything you like (e.g. *GitHub Store Dev*) |
| **Homepage URL** | `https://github.com/username/repo_name`                   |
| **Authorization callback URL** | `githubstore://callback`                    |

Then click **Create application**.

### 2 - Copy Your Client ID

After creating the app, GitHub will show:
- **Client ID** ← you need this
- **Client Secret** ← ❗ NOT required for this project

### 3 - Add It to Your Project

Open your project's `local.properties` file (root of the project) and add:
```properties
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE
```

### 4 - Sync & Run

Sync the project and run the app. You should now be able to sign in with GitHub.

### ❗ Important Notes

- `local.properties` is **not committed to Git**, so your Client ID stays local.
- This project only needs the **Client ID** (not the Client Secret).
- Each developer should create their own OAuth app for development.
