# 🗺️ Project Overview

GitHub Store is a cross-platform app store for GitHub releases, designed to simplify discovering and installing open-source software. It automatically detects installable binaries (APK, EXE, DMG, AppImage, DEB, RPM), provides one-click installation, tracks updates, and presents repository information in a clean, app-store style interface.

Built with Kotlin Multiplatform and Compose Multiplatform for Android and Desktop platforms.

## 🚀 Features

- **Smart discovery**
    - Home sections for “Trending”, “Recently Updated”, and “New” projects with time‑based filters.
    - Only repos with valid installable assets are shown.
    - Platform‑aware topic scoring so Android/desktop users see relevant apps first.

- **Latest‑release installs**
    - Fetches `/releases/latest` for each repo.
    - Shows only assets from the latest release.
    - Single “Install latest” action, plus an expandable list of all installers for that release.

- **Rich details screen**
    - App name, version, “Install latest” button.
    - Stars, forks, open issues.
    - Rendered README content (“About this app”).
    - Latest release notes (body) with markdown formatting.
    - List of installers with platform labels and file sizes.

- **Cross‑platform UX**
    - Android: opens APK downloads with the package installer, tracks installations in a local database, and shows them in a dedicated Apps screen with update indicators.
    - Desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux): downloads installers to the user’s Downloads folder and opens them with the default handler; no hidden temp locations.

## 🔍 How does my app appear in GitHub Store?

GitHub Store does not use any private indexing or manual curation rules.  
Your project can appear automatically if it follows these conditions:

1. **Public repository on GitHub**
    - Visibility must be `public`.

2. **At least one published release**
    - Created via GitHub Releases (not only tags).
    - The latest release must not be a draft or prerelease.

3. **Installable assets in the latest release**
    - The latest release must contain at least one asset file with a supported extension:
        - Android: `.apk`
        - Windows: `.exe`, `.msi`
        - macOS: `.dmg`, `.pkg`
        - Linux: `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage`
    - GitHub Store ignores GitHub’s auto‑generated source artifacts (`Source code (zip)` /
      `Source code (tar.gz)`).

4. **Discoverable by search / topics**
    - Repositories are fetched via the public GitHub Search API.
    - Topic, language, and description help the ranking:
        - Android apps: topics like `android`, `mobile`, `apk`.
        - Desktop apps: topics like `desktop`, `windows`, `linux`, `macos`, `compose-desktop`,
          `electron`.
    - Having at least a few stars makes it more likely to appear under Popular/Updated/New sections.

If your repo meets these conditions, GitHub Store can find it through search and show it
automatically—no manual submission required.

---

## 🧭 How GitHub Store works (high‑level)

1. **Search**
    - Uses GitHub’s `/search/repositories` endpoint with platform‑aware queries.
    - Applies simple scoring based on topics, language, and description.
    - Filters out archived repos and those with too few signals.

2. **Release + asset check**
    - For candidate repos, calls `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest`.
    - Checks the `assets` array for platform‑specific file extensions.
    - If no suitable asset is found, the repo is excluded from results.

3. **Details screen**
    - Repository info: name, owner, description, stars, forks, issues.
    - Latest release: tag, published date, body (changelog), assets.
    - README: loaded from the default branch and rendered as “About this app”.

4. **Install flow**
    - When the user taps “Install latest”:
        - Picks the best matching asset for the current platform.
        - Streams the download.
        - Delegates to the OS installer (APK installer on Android, default handler on desktop).
        - On Android, records the installation in a local database and uses package monitoring to keep the installed list in sync.

## ✅ Pros / Why use GitHub Store?

- **No more hunting through GitHub releases**
  See only repos that actually ship binaries for your platform.

- **Knows what you installed**
  Tracks apps installed via GitHub Store (Android) and highlights when new releases are available, so you can update them without hunting through GitHub again.

- **Always the latest release**  
  Installs are guaranteed to come from the latest published release; the changelog you see is
  exactly what you’re installing.

- **Uniform experience across platforms**  
  Same UI and logic for Android and desktop, with platform‑native install behavior.

- **Open source & extensible**  
  Written in KMP with a clear separation between networking, domain logic, and UI—easy to fork,
  extend, or adapt.

## 🔐 GitHub Store APK Signing Certificate

All official GitHub Store releases are signed with the following certificate fingerprint:

SHA-256:
`B7:F2:8E:19:8E:48:C1:93:B0:38:C6:5D:92:DD:F7:BC:07:7B:0D:B5:9E:BC:9B:25:0A:6D:AC:48:C1:18:03:CA`

## 🔑 GitHub OAuth Configuration

**TL;DR**
1. Create a GitHub OAuth App  
2. Copy **Client ID**  
3. Put it in `local.properties`

<details>
<summary><strong>Show full setup guide</strong></summary>

  <br/>
  
### 1 - Create a GitHub OAuth App
Go to:
**GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → OAuth Apps → New OAuth App**

| Field                          | Value                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Application name**           | Anything you like (e.g. *GitHub Store Dev*) |
| **Homepage URL** | `https://github.com/username/repo_name`                   |
| **Authorization callback URL** | `githubstore://callback`                    |

Then click **Create application**.

### 2 - Copy Your Client ID
After creating the app, GitHub will show:
- **Client ID** ← you need this
- **Client Secret** ← ❗ NOT required for this project

### 3 - Add It to Your Project
Open your project’s `local.properties` file (root of the project) and add:
```properties
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE
```

### 4 - Sync & Run
Sync the project and run the app. You should now be able to sign in with GitHub.

### ❗ Important Notes
- `local.properties` is **not committed to Git**, so your Client ID stays local.
- This project only needs the **Client ID** (not the Client Secret).
- Each developer should create their own OAuth app for development.
